# Counter-Strike: Source Dedicated Server ([`cstrike-srcds`](cstrike-srcds/))

[![ci](https://github.com/paulomu/gameservers/actions/workflows/cstrike-srcds_ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paulomu/gameservers/actions?query=workflow:%22GitHub%20CI:%20cstrike-srcds%22%20branch:master)

A Docker image running [srcds](https://steamdb.info/app/232330) with minimal configuration, based on [steamcmd:ubuntu-20](https://github.com/steamcmd/docker/blob/master/dockerfiles/ubuntu-20/Dockerfile). Server and game files will be downloaded in container runtime, therefore this image should not contain files such as maps, textures, mods, etc in order to keep it as tidy, unopinionated and copyright-hassle-free as possible. Server runs as the non-root `srcds` user.

A first container's boot will download all the server files to `/var/lib/srcds/data` using [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD), and it's subsequent runs are expected to incrementally update those files when/if Steam releases a new server version. It's highly recommended to mount a persistent volume to that path, so you can recreate the container as many times you want while keeping the downloaded data. Applying Steam updates should only require you to restart or recreate the container instance, without having to rebuild or pull a newer version of this Docker image.

## Usage

```shell
docker run \
    -it \
    --name cstrike-srcds \
    -v cstrike-srcds:/var/lib/srcds/data \
    -p 27015:27015/tcp \
    -p 27015:27015/udp \
    -p 27020:27020/udp \
    paulomu/cstrike-srcds:latest \
    +map de_dust2
```

Common/useful cvars: 

```
+sv_lan <0/1> - If set to 1, server is only available in LAN.
+hostname "Hostname" - Specifies the name of the server (Spaces between words won't work here!).
+maxplayers <number> - Specifies how many player slots the server can contain.
+map <map> - Specifies which map to start.
+password <password> - Specifies the server password.
+rcon_password <changeme> - Specifies the RCON password.
```

See: [Command Line Options](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Command_Line_Options#Source_Dedicated_Server) and [List of CS:S Cvars](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_CS:S_Cvars) for srcds args/cvars.

Background (detached) mode: `docker run -dit ...` 

Attach to the srcds console when running in background:

```
docker attach cstrike-srcds
```

>`CTRL-c` quits the srcds process; use `CTRL-p CTRL-q` to detach, or `--detach-keys="<sequence>"` to [override](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/#override-the-detach-sequence) it.

### With docker-compose

Clone this repository, then start the `cstrike-srcds` service in background:

```
docker-compose up -d cstrike-srcds
```

>... or just run the `Start cstrike-srcds server in background` task in Visual Studio Code ([Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) required). ðŸš€

Start an one-off `cstrike-srcds` service instance in foreground with custom params:

```
docker-compose run --service-ports cstrike-srcds +map de_inferno +maxplayers 32
```

Validating server files:

```
docker-compose run --rm cstrike-srcds \
    gosu srcds steamcmd +runscript /var/lib/srcds/validate_srcds.txt
```

Adding content to the server:

```
docker cp \
    fy_pool_day.bsp \
    cstrike-srcds:/var/lib/srcds/data/cstrike/maps/fy_pool_day.bsp
```

## Networking

List of ports that are required to be open:

- Inbound 27015/TCP: for RCON commands and server query.
- Inbound 27015/UDP: for gameplay traffic.
- Inbound 27020/UDP: for [Source TV](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SourceTV), if enabled.

## Known issues/limitations

- SIGINT stops srcds when the container runs in foreground, but not in detached
  mode. Therefore, a container stop command results in timeout = SIGKILL. 
  Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml have the explicit SIGINT config, and the
  docker-entrypoint.sh calls `exec`, which should forward the signal. Not sure
  how to fix this yet.
